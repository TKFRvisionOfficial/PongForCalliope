Pong for two Calliope Mini and one LED-Matrix (Adafruit NeoPixel 8X8)

A live presentation/trailer thingy: https://youtu.be/MS8AlEOjadA

If you want to build it yourself you will need to get two Calliope Mini and one Adafruit NeoPixel 8X8. Connect the calliopes together on ground! Then connect P0 from Calliope A to P1 from Calliope B. Then P1 from Calliope A to P0 from Calliope B. After this connect the NeoPixel to C16. It needs to look like this: https://imgur.com/mdsuK7t
If you want to use other pins you will need to change these in the code.

In the code the variables have german names but I commented this whole thing in english in the Javascript side of things. For programming I used https://makecode.calliope.cc.
